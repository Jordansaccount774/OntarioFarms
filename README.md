Should Ontario prioritize funding technology for small farms, or invest in large farms that deliver higher returns on public funding? 
Ontario's agriculture industry is faced with an important decision: whether to prioritize funding for technology adoption on small farms or to invest in large farms that generate higher profits. Small farms frequently struggle with limited resources, growing input costs, and access to new technology, while larger farms benefit from economies of scale, which increase productivity and efficiency. This choice will impact the province's agricultural production, equality, and long-term resilience. 
The stakes are high for farmers, rural communities, and the overall economy. Small farm support might boost fairness, protect rural communities, and promote the use of innovative technology, but large farm investment could maximize short-term profit while risking farm mergers. Balancing these trade-offs with restricted budgets will have an impact on farm sustainability, technology adoption rates, and the long-term use of public resources, making it a complicated but critical policy choice.
